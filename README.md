# Deni-code-quiz-hw4

This assignment was very difficult and presented many challenges. The object was to create a coding assessment with multiple choice and interactive coding challenges. The goal was to create the following:

1. A Timed, multiple choice quiz on Javascrip Fundamentals
2. Quiz will store high scores on local storage

I spent a significant amount of time on the JS side building the questions and functions to allow the quiz to begin at the click of the start button, then once answers were selected, it should switch to the next question, all while keeping score of correct and incorrect selections.

At the end of the quiz, or if time has run out, the user's score will display and the user can save their score by inputing their intials. Their score is ranked in a color coded fashion on a modal screen among others that had played.

Also, a user can click on the View High Scores at anytime to see the ranking and can opt to clear the scores if they wish.

Unfortunately, something has broken, and the start button event listener is no longer firing the quiz, so I could not provide a full screen recording of the full functionality of the quiz.
